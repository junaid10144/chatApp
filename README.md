## Key Features

- **Real-time Messaging:** Users can exchange messages with others in real-time, providing instant communication.
- **Message History:** ChatApp keeps track of message history, allowing users to view previous conversations.
- **Online Presence:** The application displays the online status of users. When a user connects or disconnects from the application.
- **File Upload:** Users can upload files (e.g., images, documents) to share with other users during conversations.
- **WebSocket Communication:** The project utilizes WebSockets to establish real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients. This enables instant messaging and updates without the need for frequent page refreshes.
- **Secure Authentication:** User passwords are securely stored using the bcrypt hashing algorithm. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for authentication and authorization.
- **User Profile:** Each user has a profile that displays their username and profile picture. Users can update their profile picture, providing a personalized touch to their chat experience.
- **Notifications:** Real-time notifications are provided when a new message is received, even if the user is in a different chat room or has the application minimized.
- **Avatar Generation:** Avatars are generated based on the username to provide personalized profile images for users.

## Technology Stack
